<p style="color:red"><em>Review of my top 3 favourite tv series</em></p>
<ol>
<li style="color:purple"><b>Breaking bad:</b> It is <b><u>perfect and the best tv show ever to be created</u><b> still it might not be a cup of their tea for some people but no can say or pinpoint a mistake in it</li>
<li><b>Lost:</b> It is a very long series containing around 120 episode but it has very few mediocre or avrage episodes and all other <em>episodes of it are highly engaging and interesting and it has great lore,story and characters</em> and it is <u>only next breaking bad for me</u></li>
<li style="color:purple"><b>The Walking dead:</b> In this list this is my first tv series that i watched and so it has a <i><u>special place in my heart</u></i> and this is also very long running and it has its mediocre parts in the middle of it but still overall it is one of greatest.</li>
