        <p>
            I am from <span class="highlight">Sathvachari</span>, a vibrant locality in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. 
            Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in <span class="highlight">Computer Science (Core)</span> at the esteemed 
            <span class="highlight">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)</span>, Vellore. I am a day scholar, and my daily commute 
            to and from the university is facilitated by my trusty bike, which adds a sense of independence and convenience to my routine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">My academic journey</span> before joining VIT was shaped by my schooling experiences. I spent the significant years 
            of my education, from 2nd standard to 12th standard, at <span class="highlight">Sunbeam CBSE School</span>, located in Mettukulam, Katpadi, a well-known area of Vellore. 
            Before that, I completed my foundational years of schooling at <span class="highlight">Holy Cross School</span> in Sathvachari, where I studied from 
            LKG to 1st standard. My earliest educational beginnings, during my pre-schooling years, took place at a school 
            <a href="#">situated conveniently near my home</a>, giving me a gentle introduction to formal education.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I have a keen interest in <span class="highlight">digital entertainment</span>, which forms a significant 
            part of how I unwind and relax. I enjoy watching <span class="highlight">movies and TV series</span>, which transport me to various 
            stories and worlds. I am also passionate about <span class="highlight">football</span>, primarily following it online, and I indulge 
            in <span class="highlight">video games</span> to challenge my strategic thinking and have fun. Platforms like 
            <span class="highlight">YouTube</span> and <span class="highlight">Instagram</span> are my go-to choices for exploring a variety of engaging 
            content, including <a href="#">videos and reels</a>.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            While these hobbies keep me occupied during regular days, <span class="highlight">I make the most of my leave days</span> by stepping out and spending quality time 
            with friends. Whether it's exploring new places, engaging in fun activities, or simply catching up over conversations, these moments add balance and joy to my life.
