<h1>ArunBala.B</h1>
<h2><i>Citizen from tamil nadu</i></h2>
<p style="color:green">I am from Sathvachari, a vibrant locality in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in<em> <u>Computer Science (Core)</u></em> at the esteemed <b>Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)</b>, Vellore. <i>I am a day scholar</i>, and my daily commute to and from the university is facilitated by my trusty bike, which adds a sense of independence and convenience to my routine.</p><br>
<p style="color:blue"><i>My academic journey before joining VIT was shaped by my schooling experiences</i>. I spent the significant years of my education, from 2nd standard to 12th standard, at <b>Sunbeam CBSE School</b>, located in Mettukulam, Katpadi, a well-known area of Vellore. Before that, I completed my foundational years of schooling at <em><b>Holy Cross School</b></em> in Sathvachari, where I studied from LKG to 1st standard. My earliest educational beginnings, during my <u>pre-schooling years, took place at a school situated conveniently near my home</u>, giving me a gentle introduction to formal education.</p><br>
<p style="color:red"><strong>Outside of academics,</strong> I have a keen interest in digital entertainment, which forms a significant part of how I unwind and relax. I enjoy watching <u>movies and TV series</u>, which transport me to various stories and worlds. I am also passionate about <u>football</u>, primarily following it online, and I indulge in <u>video games</u> to challenge my strategic thinking and have fun. Platforms like YouTube and Instagram are my go-to choices for exploring a variety of engaging content, including <u>videos and reels</u>.</p><br>
<p style="color:violet">While these hobbies keep me occupied during regular days,<strong> I make the most of my leave days by stepping out and spending quality time with friends. Whether it's exploring new places, engaging in fun activities, or simply catching up over conversations<strong>, these moments add balance and joy to my life.</p><br>
